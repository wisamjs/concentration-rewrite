## If something doesn't work

We centralize issue management for all rangle starters in the [rangle-starter](https://github.com/rangle/rangle-starter) repository, to help us keep things consistent.

Refer to the [issues section](https://github.com/rangle/rangle-starter/issues) to see if this has already been logged. Otherwise create a [new issue](https://github.com/rangle/rangle-starter/issues/new).

Be sure to tag your new issue with the 'es6-react' label so we can see which starter you're filing it for.
